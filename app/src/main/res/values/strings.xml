    <string name="charachter_design_tutorial_part1">\nCharacter design can be a tricky beast to tackle. Creating your own character from scratch involves a lot of creative thinking. \nAlthough many of the classic characters familiar to us all through cartoons, movies and advertising look straightforward, a lot of skill and effort will have gone into making them so effective.\n</string>
    <string name="charachter_design_tutorial_part2">\nBut aside from clean lines and easily readable features, what else do you need to consider for your character design? There\'s knowing what to exaggerate and what to play down, what to add to give a hint of background and depth, and what to do to develop personality. And then there\'s the matter of the technicalities of how to draw your character design. If it\'s going to be used in motion or as part of a comic strip, you\'ll need to make sure it works from any angle.\n</string>
    <string name="charachter_design_tutorial_part3">\nMany character designers will start their project with a sketch. And most agree designers agree this is often where the essence of the character is captured. So when you\'re working up your design, make sure you don\'t lose that magic.\n</string>
    <string name="charachter_design_tutorial_part4">\nFor guidance, it can be helpful to try and deconstruct why certain character designs work and why some don\'t. There\'s no shortage of research material to be found, with illustrated characters appearing everywhere: on TV commercials, cereal boxes, shop signs, stickers on fruit, animations on mobile phones, and more. Study these character designs and think about what makes some successful and what in particular you like about them.\n</string>
    <string name="charachter_design_tutorial_part5">\nIt\'s also a good idea to look beyond character designs when hunting for inspiration. "I like birds\' mating rituals a lot," laughs Rowan. The odd movements can spark unique character behaviour.\n</string>
    <string name="charachter_design_tutorial_part6">\nWhether you\'re creating a monkey, robot or monster, you can guarantee there are going to be a hundred other similar creations out there. Your character design needs to be strong and interesting in a visual sense to get people\'s attention. A good design is which one where a person could recognize your character from it\'s only silhouette.\n</string>

That pic will be saved in a folder in the gallery where you can compare it with the reference image; you can make more drawings of the reference and add them in this folder, so you can see your improvment easily.\nOnce you have uploaded a photo the path will be considered completed.</string>
